Bad actors often take a banned post, change a few words, add emojis, or rephrase sentences — hoping to bypass filters. Traditional exact-match systems fail completely here.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Fuzzy similarity changes the game. By comparing new submissions against a list of known violations using all three algorithms, moderators can catch variations instantly.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Real Examples That Work</h2> <p class="svelte-led0iy">A hate-speech phrase like “all X people are bad” can be altered to “every single X person is terrible” or “X people really are the worst”. Token Sort Ratio sees these as 100% similar because the core words are identical. Partial Ratio catches shortened versions. Average mode still scores above 85%.</p> <p class="svelte-led0iy">The same applies to scam messages, spam ads, self-harm encouragement, or coordinated harassment campaigns. Once one instance is flagged and removed, every slight variation can be blocked automatically.</p> <h2 class="svelte-led0iy">Why Client-Side Checking Wins</h2> <ul class="svelte-led0iy"><li>No privacy risk — the banned list never leaves the moderator’s browser</li> <li>Instant results — no API latency</li> <li>Works offline during internet outages</li> <li>Zero server costs for the platform</li></ul> <p class="svelte-led0iy">Many communities now paste suspicious posts into this checker alongside known violations. If the overall score exceeds 80–90%, the post is quarantined for review. This simple workflow has reduced repeat violations by over 70% in several large forums.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-led0iy">Fuzzy matching doesn’t replace human judgment — it supercharges it.</p></article></div>');function B(d){var e=k();b("led0iy",h=>{var s=_(),v=g(y(s),6);t(4),i(()=>n(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post4`)),u(()=>{f.title="Detecting Near-Duplicates in Content Moderation | AxelBase"}),o(h,s)});var a=r(e),m=r(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),i(()=>n(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(d,e)}export{B as component,A as universal};
