Each method solves a specific type of text variation.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">1. Ratio – Classic Edit Distance</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">This is based on Levenshtein distance: how many single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) are needed to turn one string into the other. It treats the entire text as one sequence. Example: "kitten" → "sitting" needs 3 edits, so similarity is 70%. Great when texts are almost identical with small typos.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">2. Partial Ratio – Best Substring Match</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">Perfect when a shorter string is contained inside a longer one. It finds the best-aligned substring. Example: searching "blast" inside "He had an absolute blast at the party" returns 100%. Extremely useful for detecting banned words hidden in sentences or short usernames inside long comments.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">3. Token Sort Ratio – Word Order Doesn’t Care About Order</h2> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">This method splits text into words (tokens), sorts them alphabetically, then compares. Example: "The quick brown fox jumps" and "jumps fox brown quick the" both become "brown fox jumps quick the" after sorting, so score 100%. Ideal for comparing sentences where word order changed but meaning stayed the same.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1apmzc4">When to Trust Which Score</h2> <ul class="svelte-1apmzc4"><li>High Ratio → texts are nearly identical (good for duplicate detection)</li> <li>High Partial → short prohibited phrase appears anywhere</li> <li>High Token Sort → same words, different order (paraphrasing)</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1apmzc4">By showing all three scores at once, you can choose the most appropriate one for your use case, or use Average/Highest mode for a balanced view.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1apmzc4">Understanding these differences helps you make smarter moderation, search, and data-cleaning decisions.</p></article></div>');function A(h){var e=k();y("1apmzc4",d=>{var s=z(),u=g(f(s),6);t(4),r(()=>l(u,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post2`)),v(()=>{b.title="How Ratio, Partial Ratio, and Token Sort Work | AxelBase"}),o(d,s)});var a=i(e),m=i(a);t(4),n(a),t(2),n(e),r(()=>l(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(h,e)}export{A as component,H as universal};
