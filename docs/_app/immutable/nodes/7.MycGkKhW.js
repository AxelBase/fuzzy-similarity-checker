Each serves a different philosophy: conservative versus aggressive.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Average Mode – Conservative & Balanced</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Takes the mathematical average of Ratio, Partial Ratio, and Token Sort Ratio. This prevents any single algorithm from dominating the result. Use this when you want a safe, balanced view and want to avoid false positives. Example: content moderation systems that prefer to let borderline cases through rather than wrongly flag innocent text.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Highest Score Mode – Optimistic & Sensitive</h2> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Returns whichever algorithm gave the highest similarity. This is extremely useful when you cannot afford to miss a match. Example: detecting prohibited phrases even if hidden inside longer sentences (Partial Ratio wins), or catching paraphrased spam (Token Sort wins). Highest Score ensures nothing slips through.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1al8b51">Real-World Recommendations</h2> <ul class="svelte-1al8b51"><li>Content moderation / spam filtering → Highest Score (better safe than sorry)</li> <li>Duplicate detection in datasets → Average (avoid false duplicates)</li> <li>Plagiarism checks for students → Highest Score (catches clever paraphrasing)</li> <li>Search relevance → Average or Highest depending on strictness</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Many teams start with Highest Score during investigation, then switch to Average for automated decisions. The tool lets you toggle instantly so you can see both perspectives side-by-side.</p> <p class="svelte-1al8b51">Remember: there is no universally “correct” mode — only the mode that matches your risk tolerance and use case.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1al8b51">Choose the mode that matches your goals — the tool gives you both so you stay in control.</p></article></div>');function z(p){var e=_();y("1al8b51",v=>{var s=w(),m=g(u(s),6);t(4),r(()=>n(m,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post3`)),f(()=>{b.title="Average vs Highest Score Mode – Which Should You Use? | AxelBase"}),o(v,s)});var a=i(e),d=i(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),r(()=>n(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),o(p,e)}export{z as component,k as universal};
