Sending every user message to a server for checking creates serious privacy and legal risks. Client-side fuzzy checking solves this elegantly.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">You load the sensitive blocklist once (locally, encrypted if needed), then every new message is compared entirely in the browser. Nothing leaves the user’s device.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1li990r">Common Scenarios</h2> <ul class="svelte-1li990r"><li>Preventing new account creation with variations of banned usernames</li> <li>Blocking coded drug sales language (“710 friendly”, “420”, etc.)</li> <li>Stopping brand impersonation (“PayPal-Support”, “Amazon Help”)</li> <li>Filtering harassment that uses spaces or symbols to bypass filters</li></ul> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Partial Ratio shines here because banned terms are usually short and appear inside longer text. A score above 90% is almost always a hit, even with deliberate obfuscation.</p> <p class="svelte-1li990r">Because everything happens in the browser, compliance teams avoid storing or logging user content while still maintaining strong protection. This approach is now used by several privacy-focused chat apps and forums.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1li990r">Privacy and safety are not mutually exclusive when the right tools are used correctly.</p></article></div>');function A(m){var e=_();b("1li990r",v=>{var s=k(),g=h(u(s),6);t(4),r(()=>n(g,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post5`)),y(()=>{f.title="Private Blocklist Checking with Client-Side Fuzzy Matching | AxelBase"}),i(v,s)});var a=l(e),d=l(a);t(4),o(a),t(2),o(e),r(()=>n(d,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),i(m,e)}export{A as component,M as universal};
